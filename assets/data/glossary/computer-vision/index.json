It has been digitised, which means it has been changed into a sequence of numbers that computers can understand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"image-acquisition\"><a href=\"#image-acquisition\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Image Acquisition</h2>\n<p>Getting images form various source such as camera , video or images . Creating blank images and saving it for future usage</p>\n<h2 id=\"image-representation\"><a href=\"#image-representation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Image Representation</h2>\n<p>Represent Images in a suitable data format so , it can be processed easily . Mostly it is represented as n-d array using numPY .</p>\n<h2 id=\"colorspaces\"><a href=\"#colorspaces\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Colorspaces</h2>\n<p>A color space is a specific organization of colors. In combination with physical device profiling, it allows for reproducible representations of color, in both analog and digital representations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thresholding\"><a href=\"#thresholding\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Thresholding</h2>\n<p>Thresholding is the simplest method of image segmentation. From a grayscale image, thresholding can be used to create binary images.</p>\n<h2 id=\"image-processing\"><a href=\"#image-processing\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Image processing</h2>\n<p>The analysis and manipulation of a digitized image, especially in order to improve its quality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gray-scale\"><a href=\"#gray-scale\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Gray-scale</h2>\n<p>In digital photography, computer-generated imagery, and colorimetry, a grayscale or greyscale image is one in which the value of each pixel is a single sample representing only an amount of light, that is, it carries only intensity information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"binary-image\"><a href=\"#binary-image\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Binary image</h2>\n<p>Binary image is a digital image that has only two possible values for each pixel. Typically, the two colors used for a binary image are black and white. The color used for the object in the image is the foreground color while the rest of the image is the background color.</p>\n<h2 id=\"optical-flow\"><a href=\"#optical-flow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Optical Flow</h2>\n<p>Optical flow or optic flow is the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and a scene. Optical flow can also be defined as the distribution of apparent velocities of movement of brightness pattern in an image.</p>\n","headings":[{"value":"Image","depth":2,"anchor":"#image"},{"value":"Image Acquisition","depth":2,"anchor":"#image-acquisition"},{"value":"Image Representation","depth":2,"anchor":"#image-representation"},{"value":"Colorspaces","depth":2,"anchor":"#colorspaces"},{"value":"Thresholding","depth":2,"anchor":"#thresholding"},{"value":"Image processing","depth":2,"anchor":"#image-processing"},{"value":"Gray-scale","depth":2,"anchor":"#gray-scale"},{"value":"Binary image","depth":2,"anchor":"#binary-image"},{"value":"Optical Flow","depth":2,"anchor":"#optical-flow"}]}},"context":{}}
