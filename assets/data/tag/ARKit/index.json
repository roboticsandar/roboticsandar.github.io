","content":"<p>Apple announced ARKit 4 alongside iOS 14 and iPadOS 14. The new version of ARKit introduces Location Anchors, a new Depth API, and improved face tracking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"location-anchors\"><a href=\"#location-anchors\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Location Anchors</h2>\n<p>Location Anchors allow developers to place AR experiences, such as life‑size art installations or navigational directions, at a fixed destination. Location Anchoring leverages the higher-resolution data in Apple Maps to place AR experiences at a particular point in the world, meaning AR experiences may now be placed at specific locations, such as throughout cities or alongside famous landmarks.</p>\n<p>Users can move around virtual objects and observe them from different perspectives, exactly as real objects are seen through a camera lens.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-depth-api\"><a href=\"#new-depth-api\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>New Depth API</h2>\n<p>ARKit 4 also takes advantage of iPad Pro's LiDAR Scanner with a brand-new Depth API with advanced scene understanding capabilities, creating a new way to access detailed per-pixel depth information. When combined with 3D mesh data, this depth information makes virtual object occlusion more realistic by enabling instant placement of virtual objects within their physical surroundings. </p>\n<p>This can offer new capabilities for developers, such as taking more precise measurements and applying effects to the environment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"face-tracking\"><a href=\"#face-tracking\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Face Tracking</h2>\n<p>Finally, face tracking is expanded in ARKit 4 to support the front-facing camera on all devices with the A12 Bionic chip or newer. Up to three faces may now be tracked at once using the TrueDepth camera to power front-facing camera experiences like Memoji and Snapchat.</p>\n"}}]}}},"context":{}}
