The new version of ARKit introduces Location Anchors, a new Depth API, and improved face tracking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"location-anchors\"><a href=\"#location-anchors\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Location Anchors</h2>\n<p>Location Anchors allow developers to place AR experiences, such as life‑size art installations or navigational directions, at a fixed destination. Location Anchoring leverages the higher-resolution data in Apple Maps to place AR experiences at a particular point in the world, meaning AR experiences may now be placed at specific locations, such as throughout cities or alongside famous landmarks.</p>\n<p>Users can move around virtual objects and observe them from different perspectives, exactly as real objects are seen through a camera lens.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-depth-api\"><a href=\"#new-depth-api\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>New Depth API</h2>\n<p>ARKit 4 also takes advantage of iPad Pro's LiDAR Scanner with a brand-new Depth API with advanced scene understanding capabilities, creating a new way to access detailed per-pixel depth information. When combined with 3D mesh data, this depth information makes virtual object occlusion more realistic by enabling instant placement of virtual objects within their physical surroundings. </p>\n<p>This can offer new capabilities for developers, such as taking more precise measurements and applying effects to the environment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"face-tracking\"><a href=\"#face-tracking\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Face Tracking</h2>\n<p>Finally, face tracking is expanded in ARKit 4 to support the front-facing camera on all devices with the A12 Bionic chip or newer. Up to three faces may now be tracked at once using the TrueDepth camera to power front-facing camera experiences like Memoji and Snapchat.</p>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/arkit4.e7f9ea6.643f72496ae48d478d5849db17534d9e.jpg","size":{"width":500,"height":282},"sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px","srcset":["/assets/static/arkit4.e7f9ea6.643f72496ae48d478d5849db17534d9e.jpg 500w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 500 282' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-683a369da482f7549881383d1a467820'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='10'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-683a369da482f7549881383d1a467820)' width='500' height='282' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAkAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAABAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYEBwj/xAAmEAACAQMDBAEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBEFBhMSITFBgRRRYaHx/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/8QAGREBAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECETEh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDyoAAABabW2c762%2br1CbjF44rdJ9VXPvK8L99yW89EWCs3LtZWkbi60zkla0JKFWFXCnCWHnCy8rsyTJnU1OxbOAANIAAAdi27qkHots4Tnd2FOGHCnLpnRqOKTT9%2bvk46bNM1K70y45rGtKlNrDx3Ul9mn2aJrM18qy8WWt36q2FR1YwoU11rleeWvJ%2bF59f0gTTfXtxfV3VuqjnN/CX4S9GYSc8QABQAAAAAAAAAAH//2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"headings":[{"value":"Location Anchors","depth":2,"anchor":"#location-anchors"},{"value":"New Depth API","depth":2,"anchor":"#new-depth-api"},{"value":"Face Tracking","depth":2,"anchor":"#face-tracking"}]}},"context":{}}
