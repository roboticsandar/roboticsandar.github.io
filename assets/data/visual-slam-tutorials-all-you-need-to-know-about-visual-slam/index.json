It maintains the information about the environment and the states of the robot as a probability density function. This includes the Kalman filter family (EKF, UKF, SEIF, etc.) in addition to the particle filter as well. </p>\n<h3 id=\"global-optimization-graphslam-approach\"><a href=\"#global-optimization-graphslam-approach\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Global optimization (GraphSLAM) Approach</h3>\n<p>The global optimization (GraphSLAM) approach which is based on saving some keyframes in the environment and uses bundle adjustment to estimate the motion. This is currently a popular approach for vision-based SLAM such as ORB-SLAM which is mentioned earlier and also Google's cartographer. </p>\n<h3 id=\"deep-learning-approach\"><a href=\"#deep-learning-approach\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Deep Learning Approach</h3>\n<p>Convolutional neural networks SLAM which is currently available as RatSLAM and proved in some situations to have superior performance. </p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-localization-\"><a href=\"#what-is-localization-\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What is Localization ?</h2>\n<p>Localization answers the question “Where Iam ?” . In more detail form it estimates the pose of the robot or Agents . </p>\n<h2 id=\"research--writing-your-own-slam\"><a href=\"#research--writing-your-own-slam\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Research : Writing Your Own SLAM</h2>\n<p>Writing and using visual SLAM requires a large amount of professional knowledge, and the real-time nature of the algorithm does not meet the practical requirements.\nIf things were so simple, SLAM theory would not have been studied by so many people for more than 30 years (it has been studied since the 1990s).</p>\n<p>You can have a general understanding of this field. However, the more you understand, the more difficult this direction becomes.</p>\n<p>SLAM can be implemented in many ways. First of all, there is a huge amount of different hardware that can be used. Secondly, SLAM is more like a concept than a single algorithm. There are many steps involved in SLAM and these different steps can be implemented using a number of different algorithms</p>\n<h2 id=\"application-and-implementation\"><a href=\"#application-and-implementation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Application and Implementation</h2>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/visual-slam.9988171.d8b0faff06254142a5a35205450b65e3.jpg","size":{"width":773,"height":366},"sizes":"(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px","srcset":["/assets/static/visual-slam.9988171.d8b0faff06254142a5a35205450b65e3.jpg 773w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 773 366' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-82b1f9baf8f1864c8a3ebafc493f0bb8'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='10'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-82b1f9baf8f1864c8a3ebafc493f0bb8)' width='773' height='366' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bf3OKr1GhK7Te1/Y2TdXNNNFXWlRokNtbqNYxNa1gryd/1neaULSe62Sq7HKbs8jjbAdEzKYZU2ZDSHAekpj7ICtv1OqobXv8AnG1lWWyZLZEqIVKBW2llwqWTsP1Eb77Y6A5yTk2tmAQOj6vaYyHM50PMXcyaebcCVJdhqTxzXkT7g8A4fvp/nK9Q6RgZqtzueqC1pV0dFp61BO3tsBgcuJlTbYkSoMMyEIq3GkKc/CCbJ4vnf7YMaMjIh6Wy1hBT0pZB8eLO5/nBYtgfULjyJiWZDiXkhO6q6avceN1zQF4EZdECZTTaWnH3A530uAkdSVp36SdrF8D4w5NOxf685DLBXJSyHS8vfa%2bB8YyriuSpJa7h6UJX0Wqt%2bsjc1ZFEe44wX1NHOGC24LIk951ZbjpV19ttfA6a6D7UTe4Fj8YQtUaXzmdmjeZiNIabfajBSX3vJkhRtuz%2baNbH2xSmYypkpyOwptJZaVGkLKOkG6opA%2bDZ3PucGG4Cyl5MiU46HKqvGvuK4woTiQJOjs470UoYZ7fqC4k%2bpSe4OCD81YPPPsMGNM6NzpvO8ue7JWhooS%2b96kFTVKJJqzZ%2b2LAjI46CnpekgJ9u5fx/5jQzl7bER5llbv8Acs9Slm7/ADzjItZIfq3qV/TGZxsrg92IHUB1yc3S3QkqokBQo/5bDe6N4k%2bnRq%2bFruBF0hnryjmSu60pt5LrLjQPkpxs2E9KbsHexQx0nqDRbWoslmQM0kLt0J7TyFFSmyDYPl9/b3F4m2gfoY/p36lt57NzGNIgQx1xmmwoOFwpq1XtW6jyb2xQ5P/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"headings":[{"value":"What is SLAM ?","depth":2,"anchor":"#what-is-slam-"},{"value":"Filter based Approach","depth":3,"anchor":"#filter-based-approach"},{"value":"Global optimization (GraphSLAM) Approach","depth":3,"anchor":"#global-optimization-graphslam-approach"},{"value":"Deep Learning Approach","depth":3,"anchor":"#deep-learning-approach"},{"value":"What is Localization ?","depth":2,"anchor":"#what-is-localization-"},{"value":"Research : Writing Your Own SLAM","depth":2,"anchor":"#research--writing-your-own-slam"},{"value":"Application and Implementation","depth":2,"anchor":"#application-and-implementation"}]}},"context":{}}
